# Data Visualization with Matplotlib
This repository showcases my skills in data visualization using Matplotlib, a powerful library for creating compelling visual representations of data.

# Metropolitan Data Analysis
The project "Metropolitan Data" demonstrates my proficiency in analyzing and interpreting complex data sets. The dataset provided contains information about income, crime rates, and other factors in a certain region. Using Matplotlib, I created several visualizations to answer questions about the data, such as:

**What is the relationship between crime rate and land area in the region?**

**How has income changed in the region since 1976?**

**What is the correlation between the number of hospital beds and the number of physicians in the region?**

# Key Learnings
Through these projects, I have honed my skills in plotting data using Matplotlib, including various types of charts and graphs such as scatterplots, barplots, lineplots, and histograms. I have also gained experience in data analysis, interpretation, and presentation, which are essential skills for any data professional.
